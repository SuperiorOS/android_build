# This is a simple product that uses configures the minimum amount
# needed to build the SDK (without the emulator).

# In order to build the bootclasspath sources, the bootclasspath needs to
# be setup via default_art_config.mk. The sources only really make sense
# together with a device (e.g. the emulator). So if the SDK sources change
# to be built with the device, this could be removed.
